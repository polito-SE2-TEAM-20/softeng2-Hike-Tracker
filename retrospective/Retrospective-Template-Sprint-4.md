TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done 
  - 9 committed vs 9 done
- Total points committed vs done 
  - 44 points committed vs 44 points done
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team)
  - 72h planned vs 73h 40m spent

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  Unexpected overlap of stories 19 and 21 caused us to exceed the estimated time a littile, but the overall error is not critical and is about 15m per person
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Usage of documentation allows to aviod doing the same stuff in case when people are not aware of each others work.
  - Properly scheduled work allows to avoid piles of work by the end of the sprint. Since we managed to complete 60% of our tasks before the lask week, we were able to easily finish the rest in the last week, thus avoiding conflicts and lots of work.
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - We decided to put more time on responsiveness of our product on the frontend, and we successfully achieved that.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - We tried to think more about task description and try to implement exactly what stakeholders want - it was possible in all stories except the one about hike tracking - we didn't follow that the stakeholders wanted the possibility to start a hike in the past.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - More coordination with stakeholders
  - Thorough task analysis before estimation, we are still not 100% aligned with stakeholders when it comes to small details

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Completing all the stories we've estimated
  - Developing such a sytsem that is easily manageable, extendable and flexible to new features.
